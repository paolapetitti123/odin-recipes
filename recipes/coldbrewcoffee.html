    <h1>Cold Brew Coffee Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/coldbrewcoffee.jpeg"> 
    <p>Coffee brewed slowly in cold water is less acidic than hot brewed. You can use this concentrate straight over ice or microwave half a mug coffee and then add a half cup of boiling water for quick hot coffee. Develop your own ratio of coffee to water for your custom brew.</p>
